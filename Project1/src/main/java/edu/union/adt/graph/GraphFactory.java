/**
 * A graph that establishes connections (edges) between objects of
 * (parameterized) type V (vertices).  The edges are directed.  An
 * undirected edge between u and v can be simulated by two edges: (u,
 * v) and (v, u).
 *
 * The API is based on one from
 *     http://introcs.cs.princeton.edu/java/home/
 *
 * Some method names have been changed, and the Graph type is
 * parameterized with a vertex type V instead of assuming String
 * vertices.
